## What it is

I've always really enjoyed studying and writing down the content I learned, however, I always had difficulty finding what I wrote down to consult when I needed it, which is why I developed this website. Here, it is possible to create articles based on categories, and filter them both by that category and by keywords. Furthermore, articles have pre-formatted tags to be written and displayed, as well as a preview of what is being written. I chose not to create documentation on how to run the project, because it has very specific characteristics for the purpose I created, in addition to not having a registration route to create an administrator (for security). However, the code is very self-explanatory for anyone who wants to try to get inspired and create something similar.
